      and aromatherapy.Their fragrance affects the heart chakra by helping to open

    <p id="pra-two">Everyone admires the blue in nature, a clear blue sky, and the deep blue sea. It seems that the earth is abundant with this cool color but ironically, blue is the rarest naturally-occurring pigment. In fact, there are only a few species that possess a true blue color both in the animal and plant kingdoms.
 With this challenging phenomenon, plant breeders, scientists, florists, and even amateurs embarked on a quest to discover a one of a kind blue rose. Over time, they learned that it doesn’t exist in the wild and it can’t be bred either so for many years, they could only long for this elusive rose.
 The blue rose has long been idolized with how often roses are used as symbols of love in art and history. Some of the first known mentions of the blue rose are in the writings of the Roman naturalist and philosopher Pliny the Elder.
 
 The blue rose is symbolic of a couple of things. It is said to represent the unattainable, which may be why some, desperate for love, seek the blue rose
